Usage: wtadd [-vh] WORKTREE_NAME [BRANCH_NAME]
Create a git worktree named WORKTREE_NAME based on BRANCH_NAME.
If no BRANCH_NAME is provided, it will default to the current branch.

Will copy over any .env, .envrc, .tool-versions, or mise.toml files to the 
new worktree as well as node_modules.

FLAGS:
  -h, --help    Print this help
  -v, --verbose Verbose mode
